# ENEE2312 Signals & Systems - MATLAB Assignment

## Overview
This assignment requires the use of MATLAB to solve and plot various signal processing tasks. Each task involves generating, manipulating, and analyzing signals based on the parameters derived from university ID number.

## ID Number Parameters
- Extract values A, B, and C from your university ID number. If any value is zero, replace it with 5. These values will be used in the equations provided in the assignment tasks.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Signal Generation and Plotting
1. **Signal A**:
   - Generate and plot the signal as per the given mathematical expression involving values A, B, and C.
2. **Signal B**:
   - Generate and plot the signal using another specified formula.

### Task 2: Signal Operations and Analysis
- **Sub-tasks**:
  1. Generate and plot x1(t) for one period.
  2. Generate and plot xb(t) = x1(t) + x2(t) for one period.
  3. Generate and plot xc(t) = x1(t) + x2(t) + x3(t) for one period.
  4. Using subplots, display all results on one figure and determine if the signals are periodic based on the plots.

### Task 3: Convolution
- Find and sketch the signal y(t) which is the convolution of two specified signal pairs.

### Task 4: LTI System Response
- **Frequency Response**:
  - Plot the amplitude and phase of the system's frequency response.
- **Time Response**:
  - Plot the time response of the system to a given square wave input over the specified time interval.

## Requirements
- Use MATLAB or MATLAB Online for all computations and plots.
- Ensure all plots are clearly labeled with axes labels and titles.
- Include your university ID on the cover page of your report to validate the parameters used in calculations.
